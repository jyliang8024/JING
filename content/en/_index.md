#### Hi, Iâ€™m Jing. 


I am currently a Senior Associate of AI Operations at the Alibaba Group, focusing on developing and optimizing AI agents for product recommendations on e-commerce platforms.

Before that, I was a researcher at the [Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence in Design](https://www.aidlab.hk/en/about) under the supervision of [Prof. C.K.M. Lee](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=QGN6-ToAAAAJ&hl=en). I received my M.Sc. degree in Industrial Logistics Systems from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University in 2023, and B.Eng. degree from Chongqing Jiaotong University in 2022. 

My research centers on the topics of **Human-AI Collaboration**. Beyond academia, I enjoy capturing the interplay of light and urban landscapes through photography and expressing rhythm as a drummer. My passion for combining AI with artistic expression inspires my work in both academia and creative pursuits.
