#### Hi, Iâ€™m Jing. 


I am currently a Senior Associate of AI Operations at the Alibaba Group, focusing on developing and optimizing AI agents for product recommendations on e-commerce platforms.

Before that, I was a researcher at the [Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence in Design](https://www.aidlab.hk/en/about) under the supervision of [Prof. C.K.M. Lee](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=QGN6-ToAAAAJ&hl=en). I received my M.Sc. degree in Industrial Logistics Systems from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University in 2023, and B.Eng. degree from Chongqing Jiaotong University in 2022. 

My primary research centers on the **design and development of Creativity Support Tools for multimedia content creation**, with a particular focus on how artificial intelligence systems can augment human creativity in game development and digital filmmaking. In the long term, I aim to expand this work toward open-ended creative scenarios, where generative models serve as real-time simulators for constructing and manipulating immersive game and film content through real-time user interactions.

Beyond academia, I have a keen interest in photography, filmmaking, and drumming, and strive to integrate Gen AI with artistic expression in both research and creative practice.
